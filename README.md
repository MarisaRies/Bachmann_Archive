# Bachmann_Archive

This public repository is a collaborative effort of participants of the module "Bioinformatik und Systembiologie" in the [**Master Program BIDS**](https://www.master-bids.hs-mannheim.de/), organized by the **Graduate School Rhein-Neckar** in cooperation with **MIRACUM**, a consortium of the **Medizininformatik-Initiative**.

Our goal is to provide the **Bachmann Model** as a fully-featured COMBINE archive, a standardized container for data files related to biological simulation studies  described by Scharm & Waltemath ([[1]](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.9379.1)).

## Contents

This COMBINE archive is a preliminary representation of a study by Bachmann *et al.* on JAK2/STAT5 signaling from 2011 ([[2]](https://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2011.50)).

## Structure

The files are organized into folders as follows:
- *documentation*: files describing the model and its characteristics, e.g. the original publication by Bachmann *et al.*.
- *model*: files describing and encoding the biological system, e.g. the model in SBML format or graphic representations.
- *experiment*: files describing and encoding the experimental setup, e.g. SED-ML simulation descriptions.
- *result*: files obtained from running *in silico* experiments, including plots and tables.
