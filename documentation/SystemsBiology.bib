            Reuse of mathematical models becomes increasingly important in systems biology as research moves toward large, multi-scale models composed of heterogeneous subcomponents. Currently, many models are not easily reusable due to inflexible or confusing code, inappropriate languages, or insufficient documentation. Best practice suggestions rarely cover such low-level design aspects. This gap could be filled by software engineering, which addresses those same issues for software reuse. We show that languages can facilitate reusability by being modular, human-readable, hybrid (i.e., supporting multiple formalisms), open, declarative, and by supporting the graphical representation of models. Modelers should not only use such a language, but be aware of the features that make it desirable and know how to apply them effectively. For this reason, we compare existing suitable languages in detail and demonstrate their benefits for a modular model of the human cardiac conduction system written in Modelica.},

            The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is an international community effort that aims to standardise the visualisation of pathways and networks for readers with diverse scientific backgrounds as well as to support an efficient and accurate exchange of biological knowledge between disparate research communities, industry, and other players in systems biology. SBGN comprises the three languages Entity Relationship, Activity Flow, and Process Description (PD) to cover biological and biochemical systems at distinct levels of detail. PD is closest to metabolic and regulatory pathways found in biological literature and textbooks. Its well-defined semantics offer a superior precision in expressing biological knowledge. PD represents mechanistic and temporal dependencies of biological interactions and transformations as a graph. Its different types of nodes include entity pools (e.g. metabolites, proteins, genes and complexes) and processes (e.g. reactions, associations and influences). The edges describe relationships between the nodes (e.g. consumption, production, stimulation and inhibition). This document details Level 1 Version 2.0 of the PD specification, including several improvements, in particular: 1) the addition of the equivalence operator, subunit, and annotation glyphs, 2) modification to the usage of submaps, and 3) updates to clarify the use of various glyphs (i.e. multimer, empty set, and state variable).},

              Motivation
              Visualization of cellular processes and pathways is a key recurring requirement for effective biological data analysis. There is a considerable need for sophisticated web-based pathway viewers and editors operating with widely accepted standard formats, using the latest visualization techniques and libraries.
            
            
              Results
              We developed a web-based tool named Newt for viewing, constructing and analyzing biological maps in standard formats such as SBGN, SBML and SIF.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              Newt’s source code is publicly available on GitHub and freely distributed under the GNU LGPL. Ample documentation on Newt can be found on http://newteditor.org and on YouTube.},

              This document defines Version 0.3 Markup Language (ML) support for the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a set of three complementary visual languages developed for biochemists, modelers, and computer scientists. SBGN aims at representing networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way to foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, storage, exchange, and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling. SBGN is defined neutrally to programming languages and software encoding; however, it is oriented primarily towards allowing models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language. The notable changes from the previous version include the addition of attributes for better specify metadata about maps, as well as support for multiple maps, sub-maps, colors, and annotations. These changes enable a more efficient exchange of data to other commonly used systems biology formats (e. g., BioPAX and SBML) and between tools supporting SBGN (e. g., CellDesigner, Newt, Krayon, SBGN-ED, STON, cd2sbgnml, and MINERVA). More details on SBGN and related software are available at
              http://sbgn.org
              . With this effort, we hope to increase the adoption of SBGN in bioinformatics tools, ultimately enabling more researchers to visualize biological knowledge in a precise and unambiguous manner.},
